# Customer Transactions Analysis Project

## Overview

This project was aimed at exploring and analyzing customer transaction data from the [Customer Transactions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bkcoban/customer-transactions) dataset. The purpose of this project was to gain insights and valuable information from the dataset using SQL queries and potentially visualize the results using Tableau.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze customer transaction data to understand casino performance and customer behavior.
- Develop SQL queries to answer specific questions about the dataset.
- Create Tableau dashboards to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and present insights.
- Learn and practice SQL, data analysis, and data visualization skills.

## Dataset

The project is based on a dataset containing the following columns:
- Customer ID
- Name
- Surname
- Gender
- Birthdate
- Transaction Amount
- Date
- Merchant Name
- Category

The dataset includes customer information, transaction details, and key attributes for analysis.

## SQL Queries

The project includes various SQL queries to perform data analysis. Some of the queries include:
- Calculating total revenue
- Finding top customers by spending
- Grouping and aggregating data by category and date
- Identifying customers with transactions at multiple merchants
- And more!

## Tableau Dashboards

To visualize the insights and KPIs from the data analysis, a Tableau dashboard was create. Some potential KPIs for visualization include:
- Total Revenue
- Gender Distribution
- Average Transaction Amount
- Merchant Performance
- Customer Age Distribution
- Most Frequent Transaction Dates


## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Download the dataset (if not included) and place it in a directory within the project.
3. Set up your SQL database or platform and connect it to the dataset.
4. Run the SQL queries provided in the project to perform data analysis.
5. Install Tableau (if not already installed) to create visualizations.
6. Use Tableau to create dashboards based on the KPIs.

## Conclusion

This project was a great opportunity to practice my SQL and data analysis skills, explore real-world data, and present insights through data visualization.
